# DSA Learning Project in Rust and C

Welcome to my personal DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Learning Project! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Rust and C. The primary goal of this project is to improve my understanding and skills in these two programming languages. However, if you find this project useful and want to contribute, you're more than welcome!

## Project Structure

The project is organized by language and then by algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/noobMushroom/Dsa.git
cd Dsa 
```
### Prerequisites

* For Rust, you will need to install ``Rust``.
* For C, you will need a C compiler like ``gcc``.


### Contributing

While this project is primarily for my personal learning, contributions are welcome! If you would like to add more algorithms, improve existing implementations, or add support for more programming languages, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Implement your changes.
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
5. Push your changes to your fork.
6. Open a pull request to the main repository.

### Adding New Algorithms

To add a new algorithm, create a new folder in the respective language directory (Rust or C) with the name of the algorithm. Add your code to this folder.

### Adding Support for New Languages

If you want to add support for a new language, create a new folder in the root directory with the name of the language. Inside this folder, create subfolders for each algorithm. Add your code to these subfolders.
